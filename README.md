# Computer Organization
This repository contains detailed descriptions and solutions for labs aimed at teaching computer architecture through the [`RISC-V`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) instruction set architecture.

## Course Synopsis
This course introduces the foundational concepts underlying modern computers and explores the interdependencies among assembly language, compilers, organization, and design, with a particular focus on the [`RISC-V`](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) instruction set architecture

## Description of labs
[lab1](https://github.com/Iane14093051/Computer_Organization/tree/main/Lab1) :
- Convert the provided C code segments into their corresponding assembly versions.

[lab2](https://github.com/Iane14093051/Computer_Organization/tree/main/Lab2) :
- Record the instruction counts for different types of RISC-V instructions.

[lab3](https://github.com/Iane14093051/Computer_Organization/tree/main/Lab3) :
- Implement at least three cache replacement policies (FIFO, LRU, LFU) in the cache simulation module of Spike.

## **note** 
You can find detailed information in the PDF files for each lab.
